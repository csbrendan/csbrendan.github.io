            <p>Automation refers to the use of software to create repeatable processes that replace or reduce manual interactions with I.T. systems. Both automation and optimization are vital to transforming an organization by augmenting or replacing manual tasks with intelligent alternatives to ensure optimal performance. It should increase the rate at which information is productively processed, reduce labor and response time, and provide greater customer satisfaction. Finally, automation should be socially beneficial, meaning less manual work and more leisure and creative time for employees.</p>

            <h2>What does automation mean for your organization?</h2>
            <p>In your business, automation may mean deploying self-service and other productivity tools that quietly but meaningfully improve core operations. It can also mean more ambitious Enterprise Cognitive Computing solutions, that significantly enhance your business operations. Embedding these new tools into your firm's existing processes will extend your capabilities and increase productivity while allowing your team to focus on more complex tasks. Deploying the right machine learning use cases will transform your organization in a way that improves employee experience and customer satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>What automation projects can be implemented in a firm?</h2>
            <p>A firm's Technology and Operations function can develop a series of online education programs for its employees that address the skills needed to work alongside co-pilots and AI assistants. Conversational AI assistants can broaden your capabilities and increase productivity by enabling your team to execute specific queries and commands in plain English on a multitude of systems instead of learning all of the different querying or scripting languages.</p>
            <p>Natural language processing is a form of artificial intelligence that allows software to understand natural language, such as speech, voice, and text, thus enabling new interfaces that can leverage your existing platforms and APIs such as Tableau, Splunk, and other internal platforms. This new option for human-to-computer interaction provides a whole new canvas on which to paint ways to interact with your systems. Just as the web enabled an entire form factor for applications like web pages, dashboards, wikis, and email allowed for alerts and notifications, conversational assistants facilitate new forms of customer engagement, assisted self-service, and 24/7 instant answers and support so your team can get the information they need.</p>
            <p>With a conversational AI assistant framework, you can onboard your team's skills and automate tasks that your employees and customers can ask the virtual assistant directly 24/7. If you have clients frequently asking for particular reports or pieces of information, consider onboarding these use cases to a conversational framework.</p>
            <p>Other tools to consider include recommendation systems which analyze large data sets within your applications and identify relevant precedents. Recommenders can help to correctly and automatically classify and categorize issues, recommend potential solutions to issues, or suggest individual SMEs, teams, or channels that can help solve problems.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How can you help the transformation?</h2>
            <p>As a technology executive, you should encourage everyone to play a role in transforming the business by contributing to automation efforts. Your team likely has domain proficiency with enterprise IT knowledge and is well-suited to chaperone realistic and credible automation ideas into existence. Encourage everyone to participate in the development of realistic use cases with clear objectives. A good use case will enhance the execution and outcome of a process and will make clear the costs and benefits of the new tool or process.</p>
            <p>Additionally, your team should aspire to obtain data science competence, starting with the understanding that high-quality data is crucial and the lack of data is an obstacle to many automation efforts. Since your team maintains the technological infrastructure of the firm, you have access to valuable operational data and should maximize its value by identifying, architecting, cleaning, and making it available to automation tools and efforts.</p>
            <p>Transforming your processes will require more than technical expertise. Only by combining business domain proficiency, enterprise architecture experience, data science competence, and enterprise-specific knowledge about processes, policies, and practices currently employed will you be able to create real business value.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How do you get it right?</h2>
            <p>Be careful not to waste valuable time and resources attempting to apply automation to processes that perhaps should not exist in the first place or to processes that won't really benefit from the change. Other reasons why automation may fail to create value include false hopes about the capability of the technology, mis-measurement of the gains, or implementation lag. For example, a team might move to a self-service solution, but spend nearly as much time hand-holding in the transition as it did performing the manual task. Organizational inertia can hold back innovation as people may be slow to adopt new processes.</p>
            <p>When new automation features are offered for testing, encourage your team to try them out and provide constructive feedback on their experience. Ensure any automated recommendation solution is within an acceptable range as this input will help to improve the capabilities of the work being done.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How can your team get started?</h2>
            <p>You can encourage your team to participate in evolutionary progress by enrolling in relevant courses. Consider offering Machine Learning courses from reputable educational platforms. This will help build the skills necessary for successful automation initiatives within your organization.</p>
